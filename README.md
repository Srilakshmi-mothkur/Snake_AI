# Snake AI

Welcome to Snake AI, a Python-based project that combines the classic Snake game with artificial intelligence (AI) to train an agent to play the game autonomously. This project uses reinforcement learning techniques to teach the agent how to navigate the game board, avoid obstacles, and collect rewards.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning**: Utilizes reinforcement learning techniques to train an AI agent.
- **Pygame Integration**: Uses the Pygame library for game development and visualization.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Allows users to train the AI agent and evaluate its performance over time.
- **Plotting**: Includes plotting functionality to visualize the agent's training progress.

   cd snake-ai
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To train the AI agent and visualize its progress, follow these steps:

1. Run the `agent.py` script:
   ```
   python agent.py
   ```

2. Watch as the agent learns to play the Snake game autonomously.

3. Monitor the training progress with the plot displayed on the screen.
